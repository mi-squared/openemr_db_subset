There are two files that are used for installing the ability to have an RSuite CLient access a database.  There are a few things that need to happen:

1) First.  We need SSH Keys on the server if we are trying to connect with a remote server

2) We need ssh access to run the rstudioConnectGrantPriv.sql file.  This file only needs to be run once as root or a root user. This script will
create a user called analytics that will be granted read-only access to the production database.  If the database is not called 'openemr' line 2 of this script
will need to be changed.  We can run this script by using the following from a command line in bash or we can copy-and-paste into
the mySQL terminal. Running this script allows the rstudioConnect run nightly so the rstudio clinent can have read only access to the analytic database.
The anayltic database is what rstudio user has read-only access to.

3) The cronjob rstudioConnect.php will query the production database.  If your database is not called openemr, find the
line "$sourceDatabase = 'openemr';" and change openemr with the name of the database you need.

To add more tables we can change the line:
$tableNames = [ 'form_vitals', 'form_encounter', 'form_observation', 'form_questionnaire_assessments'];

to include the table names that should be included in the anonymous table.  If by chance a table name is
misspelled or non-existent, the script will print a warning to the log.

The rstudio user will have to use the sshkey that is stored on the remote server.
